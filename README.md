## A real dos exe decompiler


</div>

### Description

While trying to decompile a vb exe, I made a program that decompiles dos exes and changes them back into asm. It can understand commands like, pop, push, mov, jmp, sub, add, inc, cmp, dec, and whole bunch more. It can also tell if you are decompiling a windows exe or a dos exe. This program also comes with file telling you how to make a dos program using asm in debug. Of course, it doesn't decompile absolutly every command, this is only a start for decompiling code.
