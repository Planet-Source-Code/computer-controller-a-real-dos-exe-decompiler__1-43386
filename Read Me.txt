Hello. This read me file contains information on how to make a dos test exe.
Anybody who is good at asm and debug may try other things.
OK. Here what you do:

Goto Start > Run

Type in "debug" and press enter

A dos program apears.

Type in "a" and press enter

Some numbers apear. Ignore them for now.

Type in the following things and press enter:

mov cx, 0
mov dh, 18
mov dl, 4f
mov bh, 70
mov ax, 600
int 10
mov ax, 4c00
int 21

After all that is typed in, press enter two times.

Type in "rcx" and press enter.

It should show you something like this - CX 0000

Type in "13" and press enter

Type in "n clrscr.com" and press enter

Type in "w" and press enter

It should show you something like this - Writing 0013 bytes

Type in "q" and press enter

It should look like this:

-a
134B:0100 mov cx, 0
134B:0103 mov dh, 18
134B:0105 mov dl, 4f
134B:0107 mov bh, 70
134B:0109 mov ax, 600
134B:010C int 10
134B:010E mov ax, 4c00
134B:0111 int 21
134B:0113
-rcx
cx 0000
:13
-n clrscr.com
-w
Writing 0013 bytes
-q

After that is done you goto C drive (or what ever drive you have) and find a program called clrscr.com

Change this file to clrscr.exe

Now lets check if it works.

Goto Start > Run

Type in "command"

A dos program apears.

Tell it to run the program you created.

If it changes the screen color, you did everything correct. If not, either there is something wrong with your monitor, or you did something wrong.

Open my program and tell it to decompile "C:\clrscr"

After its done open "C:\clrscr.asm" in notepad or edit. There it is! The decompiled code of the program you just compiled.
